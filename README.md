How to create the menu:

- Make sure python3 is installed
- Download the latest version of the excel sheet
- Paste it into the same folder as the script and the file called "menu.tex"
- Run ```python3 menu.py``` to start the process of generating the latex file
- Once it completes, it may automatically try to compile depending on your VSCode settings. If not, just click the green button in the upper left corner.
- After 5-10 seconds the PDF should be generated as expected.
